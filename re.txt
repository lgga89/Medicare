        <h1>What is Medicare Supplement Insurance?</h1>
        <p>
          Medicare Supplement Insurance is a form of private health insurance
          that helps cover certain Medicare out-of-pocket costs such as
          deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. Over 14 million Americans had
          a Medicare Supplement Insurance plan in 2018.1

        <h2>How does Medicare Supplement Insurance work?</h2>
        <p>
          It works alongside Original Medicare to help pay for out-of-pocket
          costs, including copayments, coinsurance and deductibles.
